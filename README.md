# Runner Mark GraphX test.

This is a stress test created by Shawn [esDotDev] to test different Adobe AIR libraries.

I made it just for fun, to remember the good old days :)

In any case, is pretty unoptimized from my end, didn't have much time, and I focused on "migrating" the original ActionScript code.

Web demo, GraphX version:
